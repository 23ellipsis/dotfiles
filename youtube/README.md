## Youtube Theming 
1. Download the Stylus extension
2. Download the Unhook extension to remove youtube recommendations
3. The `theme.txt` file contains a modified version of the BBY (Best Blue Youtube) theme, copy it and add it into Stylus.
4. The `gif.txt` file contains code that will make a gif appear in the middle of the startup screen. You can always modify it to change the gif.
5. Note that you can find other Youtube themes by openning Stylus > Find.
6. I'm also using the Nyan Cat progress bar theme btw :3
