### Shell Theming

This folder contains a modified version of the Lavanda Dark shell theme which can be found in https://github.com/vinceliuice/Lavanda-gtk-theme.

Inside the Lavanda-Dark directory, the gnome-shell directory is what determines the current shell theme. There are other directories that could be used to theme other components.
To apply the shell theme, it's enough to copy the Lavanda-Dark/gnome-shell directory into ~/.themes/ but you could also just copy the entire Lavanda-Dark directory.

Note:
1. You need to install gnome tweaks
2. You need to install the User Themes extension from Extension Manager
3. The theme is applied inside gnome tweaks ( > appearance section > Shell)
