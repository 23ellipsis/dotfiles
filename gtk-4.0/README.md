### GTK Theming

Inside this directory there are two css files: `gtk.css` and `gtk.css.bak`.

`gtk.css.bak` is the original theme found in https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Catppuccin-GTK-Theme.
`gtk.css` is the modified theme where I made the main colors darker.

The whole `gtk-4.0` directory should be added into `~/.config/` for the theme to be applied on the system.
